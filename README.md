# Kairos

Kairos is a nextflow pipeline for detecting horizontal gene transfer, distinguishing misassemblies from genuine structural variation, and inferring _in situ_ horizontal gene transfer from metagenomes and assemblies. At present, it has two workflows: 

**kairos derep-detect:** predicts putative HGTs given contigs, contig taxonomy, an MGE database, and a target gene database

**kairos assess:** sensitively detects the presence of a set of given contigs within user provided samples -- sensitive to microdiversity-level differences in sequence or gene composition
