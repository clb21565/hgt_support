# hgt_support


**hgt-support** is a lightweight bioinformatics package for identifying and interpreting the presence of structural microdiversity in metagenomes with the purpose of identifying, visualizing, and assessing the support for horizontal gene transfer. It is specifically well-suited for longitudinal metagenomic data and was designed for use in complex environmental matrices such as wastewater. There are three modules for hgt-support: 

1. hgt-support ORF-based dereplication and overlap detection. 
2. hgt-support hgt-detection using using taxonomic information contained within contigs
3. hgt-support edge mapping and variation detection

Altogether, these modules produce output that can be integrated to profile putative horizontal gene transfer, recombination, or other forms of structural microdiversity in complex environmnetal metagenomes. Integration with metadata (e.g., time/space) can be used to infer the potential for _in situ_ recombination.
